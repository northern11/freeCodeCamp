## Vagrant


Vagrant is an automation tool that aids in creating and managing virtual machines that is simple to use and allows you to set up a  environment quickly. This enviroment's exact installation and configuration can then be shared by using a Vagrantfile so other team members are all using the same environment no matter what computer they are using.

Vagrant builds easily with VMWare or VirtualMachine and takes the pain out of configuring it by hand and if different users have different versions of VirtualMachine or VMWare Vagrant will detect the version and make adjustments to work around any issues.
